# OmniLab

## The Cognitive AI Operating System

Run powerful AI workflows locally. No clouds. No limits. Pure intelligence.

---

## Overview

OmniLab is not a chatbot—it's a local-first workspace engineered for heavy intellectual lifting. Designed for engineers, architects, researchers, and writers who demand total privacy, zero latency, and raw cognitive power.

Every interaction stays on your machine. Every model runs locally through Ollama. Every decision remains yours.

## Core Features

### Forge Mode: Engineering & Architecture

The thinking environment for builders—designed to move faster and ship better.

**Blueprint Engine** — Scaffold entire project structures in seconds. Define folder hierarchies, boilerplate code, and configuration files through natural language. OmniLab writes the architecture directly to your filesystem.

**Diff Doctor** — Integrated with Git. Analyze uncommitted changes, surface bugs before they're committed, and auto-generate thoughtful commit messages. Never push incomplete work again.

**Refactor** — Context-aware code cleaning. Improve readability, consistency, and maintainability without breaking functionality.

### Nexus Mode: Research & Writing

The thinking environment for synthesis—learn deeper and remember better.

**Flashpoint** — Upload PDFs, research papers, or notes. OmniLab instantly transforms them into spaced-repetition flashcards. Build active recall workflows at scale.

**Podcast Protocol** — Complex synthesis deserves a voice. Text-to-speech rendering turns long-form summaries and analyses into listenable audio. Learn while you commute.

**Deep Context** — Semantic vector search across document collections. Find connections across hundreds of pages in milliseconds. Navigate ideas your linear brain might miss.

### Lab Bench

The centerpiece of OmniLab's interface—a split-screen artifact viewer that eliminates window-switching.

- Live HTML/JS previews rendered side-by-side with chat
- Full-height code reviews without scrolling chaos
- Flashcard studying while you work
- Seamless mode switching without leaving the workspace

The Lab Bench is where thinking and building converge.

## Privacy & Security

OmniLab is built on a single principle: **your data never leaves your machine**.

**100% Local** — Ollama runs on your hardware. No API calls. No analytics. No servers.

**Proprietary Models** — Bring your own model via Ollama. Use Llama 2, Mistral, or any GGUF-compatible model.

**Zero Telemetry** — OmniLab doesn't phone home. Ever.

**Offline Capable** — Works offline after launch (except for initial Ollama downloads).

This is cognitive AI without compromise.

## Usage Examples

### Forge Mode Example

```
Prompt: "Create a Next.js SaaS starter with TypeScript, Tailwind, and Stripe"

Result: OmniLab scaffolds 20+ files instantly:
├── src/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── components/
│   └── lib/
├── tailwind.config.ts
├── stripe.config.ts
└── package.json
```

Then analyze code changes before committing:

```bash
git diff
```

OmniLab detects issues, flags concerns, and writes commit messages.

### Nexus Mode Example

```
Upload: research_paper.pdf + notes.md

OmniLab creates:
✓ 50 active-recall flashcards
✓ Searchable vector index
✓ 15-minute audio summary (Podcast Protocol)
```

Open the Lab Bench, flip between flashcards and chat. Study while you think.
