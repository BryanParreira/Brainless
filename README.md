## ⚡ Overview

**OmniLab is not a chatbot.** It is a local-first workspace engineered for heavy intellectual lifting. Designed for engineers, architects, researchers, and writers who demand total privacy, zero latency, and raw cognitive power.

Every interaction stays on your machine. Every model runs locally through **Ollama**. Every decision remains yours.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before launching OmniLab:
* **[Ollama](https://ollama.ai)** (Must be running on port `11434`)
* **[Git](https://git-scm.com)** (Required for *Forge* mode features)

### 2. Installation

| Platform | Download Link | Architecture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **macOS** | [**Download .dmg**](https://github.com/BryanParreira/OmniLab/releases) | Intel & Apple Silicon |
| **Windows** | [**Download .exe**](https://github.com/BryanParreira/OmniLab/releases) | x86_64 & ARM64 |
| **Linux** | [**Download .AppImage**](https://github.com/BryanParreira/OmniLab/releases) | Universal |

### 3. Launch
1.  Install the binary.
2.  OmniLab automatically detects your local Ollama instance.
3.  Select **Forge** or **Nexus** mode to begin.

## 💎 Core Architecture

OmniLab operates in two distinct cognitive modes, unified by the **Lab Bench**.

### 🛠️ Forge Mode: Engineering & Architecture
*The thinking environment for builders—designed to move faster and ship better.*

> **Blueprint Engine**
> Scaffold entire project structures in seconds. Define folder hierarchies, boilerplate code, and configuration files through natural language. OmniLab writes the architecture directly to your filesystem.

> **Diff Doctor**
> Integrated with Git. Analyze uncommitted changes, surface bugs before they're committed, and auto-generate thoughtful commit messages.

> **Refactor**
> Context-aware code cleaning. Improve readability and consistency without breaking functionality.

### 🧠 Nexus Mode: Research & Writing
*The thinking environment for synthesis—learn deeper and remember better.*

> **Flashpoint**
> Upload PDFs or notes. OmniLab instantly transforms them into spaced-repetition flashcards for active recall.

> **Podcast Protocol**
> Text-to-speech rendering turns long-form summaries and analyses into listenable audio. Learn while you commute.

> **Deep Context**
> Semantic vector search across document collections. Find connections across hundreds of pages in milliseconds.

### ⚗️ The Lab Bench
The centerpiece of the interface—a split-screen artifact viewer that eliminates window-switching.
* ✓ Live HTML/JS previews rendered side-by-side with chat
* ✓ Full-height code reviews without scrolling chaos
* ✓ Seamless mode switching without leaving the workspace

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

OmniLab is built on a single principle: **your data never leaves your machine.**

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **100% Local** | Ollama runs on your hardware. No API calls. No analytics. No servers. |
| **BYO Model** | Use Llama 3, Mistral, or any GGUF model via Ollama. |
| **Zero Telemetry** | OmniLab doesn't phone home. Ever. |
| **Offline Capable** | Works fully offline after initial setup. |

## 🧪 Usage Workflows

### The "Scaffold & Audit" Workflow (Forge)
1.  **Prompt:** *"Create a Next.js SaaS starter with TypeScript, Tailwind, and Stripe."*
2.  **Result:** OmniLab generates the directory tree:
    ```bash
    ├── src/
    │   ├── components/
    │   └── lib/
    ├── tailwind.config.ts
    └── package.json
    ```
3.  **Audit:** Run `git diff` inside OmniLab to have the AI review your changes before the first commit.

### The "Synthesis" Workflow (Nexus)
1.  **Upload:** Drop a `research_paper.pdf` onto the Lab Bench.
2.  **Generate:** OmniLab creates:
    * 50 active-recall flashcards.
    * A searchable vector index.
    * A 15-minute audio summary (Podcast Protocol).
3.  **Study:** Flip through cards on the left while chatting with the document on the right.
